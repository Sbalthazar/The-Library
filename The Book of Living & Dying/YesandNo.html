<h1>Yes & No</h1>

<p>Yes!</p>
<p>No!</p>

<p>Affirmative and negative</p>
<p>Permission and rejection</p>
<p><i>I want</i> and <i>I don't want</i></p>

<p>The baby or toddler learning to say no for the first time</p>

<p>People who only say no</p>
<p>And people who only say yes</p>
<p>The whole art is knowing when to say no and when to say yes</p>

<p>Yes is love.</p>
<p>No is fear.</p>

<p>You must first say no,</p>
<p>So that you can then say a true yes!</p>

<p>Saying yes to your fear, saying yes even to your no.</p>
<p>Absolutely no resistance to life.</p>

<p>What do you say "No" to?</p>

<p>You must first reject all,</p>
<p>So that your acceptance is real.</p>

<p>The deep YES in the depths of your being.</p>
<p>Affirming all of life.  The joys as well as the sorrows. </p>
