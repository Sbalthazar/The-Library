<h1>De-Stabilization</h1>

<div>We are in the midst of times of great de-stabilization.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Old structures are crumbling, old ideas and ways of doing things are no longer adequate.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The earth is shaking as the walls of the Old World crumble into dust. &nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It is like an old car that the passengers have ridden as far as it could go, and now it is shaking and coughing as it sputters to a stop. &nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We are experiencing intense death throes and birth pangs. &nbsp;For a long over-due story is closing its final chapter, and a new is struggling to be created.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>In times of de-stabilization human beings will react in vastly different ways.</div>
<div>Some will go crazy, and some will go sane.</div>
<div>The increased energies will activate some in a negative way and others in a positive. &nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Some will be lost without the old, familiar structures and will seek to hold on to their sinking ship.&nbsp;</div>
<div>While others will be shaken awake and find that this <u>time of crisis is also a time of opportunity.</u></div>
<div><u>&nbsp;</u></div>
<div>Many will try to go backwards to the comfort and security of the past.</div>
<div>Many will be lost and confused as where to go now.&nbsp;</div>
<div>The few will find their catalyst in these times of de-stabilization and&nbsp;lay the groundwork for a new building. &nbsp;A totally new structure that is free of the past.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Keep your center in these times of chaos, confusion, and de-stabilization.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>It is you brave few who will forge ahead and&nbsp;build a New Earth out of the ashes of the old.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
