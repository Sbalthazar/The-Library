<h1>Yes & No</h1>

<p>
Yes!

No!

Affirmative and negative
Permission and rejection 
I want and I don't want 

The baby or toddler learning to say no for the first time 

People who only say no
And people who only say yes
The whole art is knowing when to say no and when to say yes 

Yes is love
No is fear

You must first say no
So that you can then say a true yes!

Saying yes to your fear, saying yes even to your no 
Absolutely no resistance to life 

What do you say "No" to?

You must first reject all 
So that your acceptance is real 

The deep YES in the depths of your being
Affirming all of life.  The joys as well as the sorrows </p>
