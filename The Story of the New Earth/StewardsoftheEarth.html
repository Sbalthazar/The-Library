<h1>Stewards of the Earth</h1>

<p><em>We are stewards upon the earth.</em><br /><em>And t</em><em>he Earth is not ours, but belongs to all beings.</em></p>
<p><em>We are cosmic travelers, not really from earth.</em><br /><em>She has been our womb and allowed us to incarnate here </em><br /><em>She has given us a body and fed us with her bounty.</em></p>
<p><em>Humans do not own earth</em><br /><em>It is not theirs to destroy .</em><br /><em>Thus, we are stewards here, gardeners of this beautiful world.</em><br /><em>We are here to tend to the Garden with wisdom and love</em></p>
<p><em>Now is the time for Humanity to consciously take on its role of <strong>Planetary Stewardship</strong></em></p>
<h3>Spoken Word Version of this Message</h3>
<p>[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwYuPjk9x_0]</p>
<h3>Why have we become disconnected?</h3>
<p>People see the earth as a dead &ldquo;thing&rdquo;<br />Not alive, not sacred<br />Not as their earthly mother, their very flesh and blood</p>
<p>They see the earth as a dead inanimate object<br />And so they feel no pain in causing it pain, in destroying it, polluting it<br />In using it as a means for their end</p>
<p>Because we have become so disconnected from ourselves and the earth and the divine/god/cosmos</p>
<p>We are stewards of the earth, and it is our responsibility to care for her.</p>
<h3>How can we reconnect with the earth?</h3>
<p>- sacred plants<br />- make the effort to be in nature, in forests, take walks, garden,<br />- stories, poetry, mythos, inspiring movies, books,</p>
<p>We need a mythos that honors the earth and helps people to feel intimately connected with Her<br />The indigenous and ancient cultures had this mythos, and they lived close to the earth</p>
<p>Our technology and fast paced, work driven modern life keep us disconnected, separated, occupied, distanced from nature</p>
<p>Gaia&rsquo;s weather fluctuations are signs that she is out of balance<br />They are also signs that she is sending to us that she needs help</p>
<h3>Gaia is a Sentient Consciousness</h3>
<p>It is possible to commune with the earth<br />To feel her, to communicate with her<br />That she truly is a sentient being of great consciousness and of great compassion and love for her children.</p>
<p>And not just Gaia<br />But trees, flowers, plants, animals - all things - are alive, are our brothers and sisters, require loving attention.</p>
<p>The earth will not be healed until the separation within human consciousness is healed.<br />We are split within ourselves, and thus we are disconnected from other humans, from the earth, and from All That Is.</p>
<p>It is time to become conscious stewards of Gaia, our Earthly Mother and our Home.<br />It is time to mature as a species and take the responsibility of Planetary Stewardship.</p>
