<h1>To Live, You Must Die</h1>

<p>
To live you must die<br>
Live fully and die
</p>
<p>
The fear of death prevents the experience of life
</p>
<p>
In order to be rid of the fear of death<br>
You must die
</p>
<p>
To live you must die<br>
To die you must first live<br>
And to live you must wake
</p>
<p>
To get what you most deeply desire you have to experience what you most deeply fear
</p>
<p>
<em>To live you must die</em>
</p>
<p>
One can die any moment,<br>
and that is why you must live each moment
</p>
