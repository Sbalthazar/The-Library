<h1>What if...?</h1>

<p>
What if... this is paradise?<br>
What if... this is your home? (Where you are right now, wherever you are…)<br>
What if… this is the Kingdom of Heaven?<br>
What if... this world and this life is a playground specifically built for your pleasure, growth, well-being, and happiness?
</p>
<p>
What if... this is perfection? That the imperfection of life is it’s very perfection?<br>
What if... everything you deeply long for and desire is here/now?<br>
What if… everything is as it is, as it must be, as it should be?<br>
What if... everything you ever sought for is already yours, and your birthright?<br>
</p>
<p>
What if… there is nobody to become, nothing to do, nowhere to go, nothing missing or lacking?
</p>
<p>
What if... you allowed yourself to relax, to rest, to feel <em>this?</em><br>
What if... you gave yourself permission to let-go of all argument with oneself, with others, and with existence/God?
</p>
<p>
What if... you are whole now, you are wholeness itself -  even in the midst of feeling broken, lost, or incomplete?<br>
What if... what you most deeply fear is only the flip side of what you most deeply desire?<br>
What if... in the shadows of your being is hidden your gold?
</p>
<p>
What if… you chose your life to be exactly as it is so that you could grow exactly as you need to grow?<br>
What if... your freedom is your ultimate received gift?
</p>
<p>
What if... everything is love?<br>
What if… love is the gravity which holds the universes and each atom together?<br>
What if... everything loves you and you secretly love every thing?
</p>
<p>
What if… your death is the most beautiful experience of your life?<br>
What if… death is a great blessing?<br>
What if… death is the crescendo of the symphony of your life?<br>
What if… death is but the beginning of the next great adventure?
</p>
<p>
What if... you are the only begotten Son or Daughter of God?<br>
What if… you <em>are</em> God?<br>
What if... you are the consciousness, and the only consciousness, by which God experiences itself? Sees and knows himself?
</p>
<p>
What if... you are the only One here?<br>
What if… only THIS exists and has ever existed?<br>
What if… all is well, all is unimaginably well… and there is nothing to do other than enjoy yourself?  To celebrate and rejoice?

<p>
The only way there, is to <em>be</em> there
